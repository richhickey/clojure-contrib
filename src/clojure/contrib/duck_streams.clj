;; This file defines "duck-typed" I/O utility functions for Clojure.
;; The 'reader' and 'writer' functions will open and return an
;; instance of java.io.BufferedReader and java.io.PrintWriter,
;; respectively, for a variety of argument types -- filenames as
;; strings, URLs, java.io.File's, etc.  'reader' even works on http
;; URLs.
;;
;; Note: this is not really "duck typing" as implemented in languages
;; like Ruby.  A better name would have been "do-what-I-mean-streams"
;; or "just-give-me-a-stream", but ducks are funnier.


;; CHANGE LOG
;;
;; February 16, 2009: (lazy branch) fixed read-lines to work with lazy
;; Clojure.
;;
;; January 10, 2009: added *default-encoding*, so streams are always
;; opened as UTF-8.
;;
;; December 19, 2008: rewrote reader and writer as multimethods; added
;; slurp*, file, and read-lines
;;
;; April 8, 2008: first version
